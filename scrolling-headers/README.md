# Scrolling (Push) Headers

### Objectives

1. Position the month titles, rotated 90 degress, at the top of the beginning
   of each month, in the 50px gutter to the left of the grid.

   NOTE: No need to worry about vendor prefixes, unless Chrome needs 'em.

1. Implement "push headers" on the month titles, such that they are sticky
   while the user is currently scrolling over the month they label.

Feel free to ask questions and/or lookup whatever you need to online.
