# Python DevTest

This is a python test file. It uses a standard unittest class to run various
tests.  When all tests are passing, please submit your answer by emailing me
the python file.

## Instructions
1. In the same directory, create a devtest.py file
1. Create a "Solutions" class and implement all the methods in the class to get
   the tests to pass
1. Run the command `python tests.py` to run the tests

  If you want to run an individual test, you can reference it like so:

  ```
  python tests.py SolutionsTestCase.test_greater_than_avg
  ```

Good luck!
